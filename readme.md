**causal-strength** is a Python package for evaluating the causal strength between statements using various metrics such as CESAR (Causal Embedding Similarity with Attention Reweighting). This package leverages pre-trained models available on [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) for efficient and scalable computations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage  ![Usage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Usage-Instructions-green)

### Quick Start
Here's a quick example to evaluate the causal strength between two statements:

```python
from causalstrength import evaluate

# Define your statements
cause = "Fire starts."
effect = "House burns."

# Evaluate causal strength
score = evaluate(cause, effect, model_name='CESAR', model_path='YourUsername/cesar-model')
print(f'Causal strength between "{cause}" and "{effect}" is {score:.2f}')
```

### Evaluating Causal Strength

The `evaluate` function computes the causal strength between two statements.

```python
from causalstrength import evaluate

# Statements to evaluate
s1 = "Rain falls."
s2 = "Ground gets wet."

# Evaluate using CESAR model from Hugging Face
score = evaluate(s1, s2, model_name='CESAR', model_path='YourUsername/cesar-model')
print(f'Causal strength: {score:.2f}')
```

**Parameters:**

- `s1` (str): The cause statement.
- `s2` (str): The effect statement.
- `model_name` (str): The name of the model to use (`'CESAR'`, `'CEQ'`, etc.).
- `model_path` (str): Hugging Face model identifier or local path to the model.

### Generating Causal Heatmaps

Visualize the attention and similarity scores between tokens using heatmaps.

```python
from causalstrength.visualization.causal_heatmap import generate_causal_heatmap

# Statements to visualize
s1 = "Fire starts."
s2 = "House burns."

# Generate heatmap
generate_causal_heatmap(
    s1,
    s2,
    model_name='YourUsername/cesar-model',
    save_path='causal_heatmap.pdf'
)
```
